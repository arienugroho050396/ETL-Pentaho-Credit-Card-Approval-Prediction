## Introduction   
Credit score cards are a widely employed risk management approach in the financial industry. They leverage personal information and data provided by credit card applicants to assess the likelihood of potential defaults and credit card usage. By doing so, banks can make informed decisions on whether to grant credit cards to applicants. Credit scores provide an objective measure of risk magnitude, allowing for a more precise evaluation of creditworthiness.

## Objective
- Perform ETL using PDI for both datasets.
- Create time dimension using PDI.
- Create fact table using PDI.
